# GhostsGhoulsGoblins
This repository contains the training and test data sets from the Kaggle "Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!" Competition. Code for different predictive models can also be found. The purpose of participating retrospectively in this competition was to learn predicictive models for classification other than just a bianary response. In this specific competition, we predicted whether a certain observation was ghost, ghoul, or a goblin.

A few notable models used were Naive Bayes and BART. Models were scored using accuracy and a Naive Bayes model with cross validation resulted in the best accuracy score according to the competition test set. 

For learning purposes, I took out certain data pieces and practiving imputation, evaluating under rmse with the full data set.
